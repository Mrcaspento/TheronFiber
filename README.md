 Orginization is Key


The first thing I decided to do is to go through the "html" code file and look for typos. My next step was organizing sections of code to represent a element for a cleaner look and replaced some random "div's" with "article" & "section". Had to add the class element "search-engine-optimization" to line 38 so the link would work as intended to. Then I added some notes into the "html" file to help with anyone using devolper tools to easily navigate the code. After I settled with the best I can do. So I moved on to the "style.css" sheet were I was aghast when I saw how many elements that were listed. Many of the elements were superfluous, so I grouped them together since the values would be the same. It was something worth noting for any future assignment or project that I can clean up and condense some of my css, one thing I was so pressed on accomplihing was trying to group some of my css elements like you would in "html" files a more horizontal then vertical list. What I did learn was that I will be extremely more inclined to make my code more legiable to anyone if they were to read it and check the elements, I want to leave enough detail that descibes some sections of my code its not just a title, its a picture that I'm able to paint that anyone one with a disaabilty can vividly see wether or not they are using a screen reader or braile keyboard.
